# Fraud Detection App

- This repository demonstrates fraud detection model in credit card transaction.
- For a model we are using first 1.048M transactions of this dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/credit-card-transactions-dataset 
      (out of 1.85M in total)
- The model is an ensemble of XGBoost and Light GBM models

## 🚀 Live Demo
👉 [Streamlit Cloud App](https://fraud-detection-app-bxejrzq5zjleniz8ktbnfa.streamlit.app/)  

- The application consists of 3 tabs: ℹ️ "About", 🔮 "Prediction", 📊 "Metrics"

		- ℹ️ "About": holds this README.md file
		- 🔮 "Prediction" : decides whether transaction is FRAUD/LEGIT based on user's input
		- 📊 "Metrics" : allows user to run series of predictions based on his/her data file. See data file structure below
